# FlightManagement
project manage booking flight....
This is a great exercise that ends the subject of data structure and algorithms. I am very happy because I passed this subject when I studied for the first time because this is a nightmare for so many generations of PTIT students. This project is in addition to a few shortcomings in the capture of business errors, it is quite complete and complete. Besides, I also refer to the previous student project. With this project I got 7, enough points to pass the course. yahh !!
